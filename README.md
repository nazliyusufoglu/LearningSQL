# LearningSQL

At this repository, i am actually sharing my learning Sql process with simple codes
I used an postgresql database and made some queries. In this repostory, there are task folders and they represent to different query assignments -the questiones are given by pictures in the same folder- And also there are many files without any questions. But they have comment lines to understand what they are actually executed for.
